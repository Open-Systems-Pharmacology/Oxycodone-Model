# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body pediatric PBPK model of oxycodone that has been developed and validated using data from previous clinical PK studies.

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies conducted in adults and children. An illustration of workflow of the modeling process was given in [1].
